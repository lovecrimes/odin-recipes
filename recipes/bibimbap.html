  <h1>Bibimbap recipe!</h1>
  <img src="Img/bibimbap.jpeg"  >
   <h3>Description</h3> 
    <p>Bibim (비빔) translates as “mixed,” and bap (밥) means “cooked rice,” so bibimbap literally means “mixed rice.” Before eating it you’re supposed to mix everything all together.</p>
    <p>There are many variations on this dish, from simple to elaborate, and this recipe I’m showing you today is for one you could consider “classic” bibimbap. 
        If you ordered bibimbap in a Korean restaurant, you would probably get something like this dish, with regional variations. I’m also going to show you bibimbap prepared and 
        served in a heated stone or earthenware bowl called dolsot-bibimbap (돌솥비빔밥). “Dolsot” means “stone pot” in Korean, and this version is well-known for the way the bowl makes a 
        layer of crispy, crackling rice on the bottom of the bibimbap.</p>
