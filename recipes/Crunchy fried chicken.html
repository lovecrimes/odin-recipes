      <p>mmmmm chicken</p>
    <h3>Ingrediants</h3>
     <ul><li>2 pounds chicken wings</li>
      <li>kosher salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cup potato starch</li>
      <li>1/4 cup all purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      </ul>
     <h3>For the sauce</h3> 
      <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons veg oil</li>
        <li> 3 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1/3 cup ketchup</li>;
        <li>1/3 cup rice syrup</li>
        </ul>
     <h3>Directions</h3>   
      <ol>
        <li>Heat 2 inches of oil in a large heavy frying pan or pot over medium hight heat for about 10 to 12 minutes until it reaches 330-350ºF. I used my 12 inch pan but if your pan is smaller, work by batches. If you don’t have a thermometer, test it by dipping one piece of chicken in the oil. If it bubbles, it is ready.</li>
        <li>While the oil is heating, combine chicken, salt, ground black pepper, starch, flour, baking soda, and eggs in a bowl. Mix altogether well by hand.</li>
        <li>Add the coated chicken to hot oil one by one. Fry them for 12 minutes until the all sides of the chicken are crunchy, turning over with tongs.</li>
        <li>Take out the chicken with tongs or a large slotted spoon to wire strainer over a bowl to remove the excess oil.</li>
      </ol>
     <h3>For the sauce</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat the 2 teaspoons vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Stir in garlic until light brown for about 30 seconds. Add the ketchup, rice syrup, gochujang, vinegar and stir well with a wooden spoon. Reduce the heat to low and stir until bubbling. Remove from the heat.</li>
